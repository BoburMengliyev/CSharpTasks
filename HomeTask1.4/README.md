## Task1

### Inheritance: Superclass Person and its Subclasses

Suppose that we are required to model students and teachers in our application.

![image](./Pictures/image.png)

- We can define a superclass called `Person` to store common properties such as name and address, and subclasses `Student` and `Teacher` for their specific properties.

- For students, we need to maintain the courses taken and their respective grades.

- We should be able to add a course with a grade, print all courses taken, and calculate the average grade.

- We assume that a student takes no more than 30 courses throughout the program.

- For teachers, we need to maintain the courses currently taught and be able to add or remove a course taught.
- We assume that a teacher teaches no more than 5 courses concurrently.

## Task2

### Bird Watcher `Instructions`

- You're an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds  
  have visited your garden in the last seven days.
- You have six tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.

### Check what the counts were last week

- For comparison purposes, you always keep a copy of last week's counts nearby, which were: 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8 and 4. Implement the BirdCount.LastWeek() method that returns last week's counts:
