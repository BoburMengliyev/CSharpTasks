1. Create a base class called `Transport`. Inherit from it to create classes called `Car` `Airplane`, and `Train`.  
   Inherit from the `Car` class to create classes called `PassengerCar` and `CargoCar`. Inherit from the `Airplane` class to create classes called `CargoPlane` and `PassengerPlane`.
2. Define properties for the base class and add properties to the derived classes that specifically characterize the objects of the derived classes.

3. Define constructors and methods to populate the properties. Write a method that displays information about the type of transport and its characteristics.
